# Decentronland
Decentronland is a decentralized virtual reality platform powered by the TRON blockchain. Within the Decentronland platform, users will be able to create, experience, and monetize their content and applications.

The finite, traversable, 3D virtual space within Decentraland is called LOTS, a non-fungible digital asset maintained in a TRON smart contract. Land is divided into parcels that are identified by cartesian coordinates (x,y). These parcels are permanently owned by members of the community and are purchased using TRX,. This gives users full control over the environments and applications that they create, which can range from anything like static 3D scenes to more interactive applications or games.

Some parcels WILL BE organized into themed communities, or Districts. By organizing parcels into Districts, the community can create shared spaces with common interests and uses. The content that makes up Decentraland is stored and distributed via a decentralized network while ownership and transactions are validated on the TRON blockchain.

While DecentrONLAND is still under active development and there is currently no way to access the world, it will support several platforms: you will be able to access Decentronland from a mobile device, a web browser, or a VR headset to enhance your immersive experience.
